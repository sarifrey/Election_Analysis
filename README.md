##Overview of Election Audit
The election commission, while pleased with the election audit results, wants additional data. 
They would like these data points:
*The voter turnout for each county
*The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
*The county with the highest turnout

These results will assist the election commission in closing the election audit.
